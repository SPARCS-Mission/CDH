# SPARCS Mission CDH Repository : Learning Workspace & Future Development

Welcome to the SPARCS Mission Command and Data Handling (CDH) repository!
This repo is currently a learning playground for our team as we explore embedded software development with Zephyr RTOS, F´ (Fprime), and STM32 microcontrollers.
Our long-term goal is to build robust, modular, and flight-ready software for the SPARCS satellite.

## 🎯 Current Purpose

This repository is a safe space for experimentation and hands-on learning.
Here you’ll find:

+ Zephyr RTOS sample applications
+ F´ (Fprime) test projects
+ STM32 microcontroller demos
+ Notes and guides as we learn

All code here is experimental and meant for learning, not for production or flight software.

## 🚀 Long-Term Goals

As we gain experience, this repository will evolve into the core software platform for SPARCS CDH.
Our goals:

+ Build a modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase for satellite command and data handling
+ Integrate Zephyr RTOS and F´ (Fprime) for robust, real-time operations
+ Implement reliable interfaces for all major subsystems (ADCS, EPS, Payload, etc.)
+ Develop fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) mechanisms
+ Ensure clear documentation and traceability for every component and firmware
+ Support both simulation and flight hardware environments
